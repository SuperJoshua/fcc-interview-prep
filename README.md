# Coding Interview Prep

> "If you're looking for free coding exercises to prepare for your next job interview, we've got you covered. This section contains dozens of coding challenges that test your knowledge of algorithms, data structures, and mathematics. It also has a number of take-home projects you can use to strengthen your skills, or add to your portfolio."

This is a work in progress. Exercises that I've completed are hyperlinked.

## Algorithms

> "These free programming exercises will teach you about some common algorithms that you will likely encounter in real life. They are a great opportunity to improve your logic and programming skills. These algorithms are frequently used in job interviews to test a candidate's skills. We'll give you clear and concise explanations of how these different algorithms work so you can implement a solution for each one."

## Take-home Projects

> "Programming interviews have always been stressful. Job applicants are sometimes given a take home project to be completed outside of the interview. These types of interviews usually require a lot of work, but they're a great way for employers to see how you might perform on the job. Build the bonus coding projects below for extra practice. Take your time, make them great, and put them on your resume or portfolio to show potential employers."
